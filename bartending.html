    <h1>Bartending</h1>
    <div></div>
    <p>Bartending for the past four years has been lucrative as a student. But it started out as fairly stressful as there was a lot to learn and the fast-paced
      nature of the industry is not easy for beginners.</p>
	  <p>Most bars are stocked with beer, wine and liquor with several varieties of each. Some bars go further to brand themselves as cocktails bars or specialty
      shot bars both which require more training and ingredients.</p>
	  <p>After being trained and getting some more experienced, I have learned much more about the types and production methods of beer and wine in addition to
      some of the more obscure cordials and classic cocktails. </p>
