    <h1>Weightlifting</h1>
    <div></div>
    <p>Weightlifting can be used for many different purposes such as losing weight, gaining size, becoming more toned, or endurance improvement.
      When combined with a proper diet (with some weightlifters even tracking their macros daily), weightlifting is one way many have achieved personal goals.</\p>
	  <p>My personal goal is to put on some size. So for most of my lifts, I try and use higher weight with medium to higher numbers of repetitions.</p>
	  <p>And generally with a goal similar to mine protein intake is crucial. Generally I try to consume at least a gram of protein per pound of body weight.
      I currently weigh 170 pounds, so my preferred daily goal is between <b>170 and 200 grams</b> of protein per day.</p>
	  <p>As far as my workouts, I try and plan to workout between 45 minutes and an hour and focusing on a specific muscle group.
      Sometimes I divide between just push and pull muscles, but if I am pressed for time, I divide each of those groups into upper and lower body.</p>
